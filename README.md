## Full Code and outputs could be found here: [Code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jasminemohamed2545/detecting-ai-text-0-98-svm-nn-full-ml-guide)
An end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that builds and evaluates multiple machine learning models to distinguish between essays written by students and those generated by AI. This repository demonstrates a complete and structured machine learning workflow, from initial data exploration to final model comparison.

## üìä Key Visualizations & Insights

This project yields several key insights into the data and model performance. The final comparison clearly shows that the **Neural Network** achieved the highest accuracy in classifying the essays.



The confusion matrix for our best model, the Neural Network, shows its effectiveness in correctly identifying both AI-generated and student-written essays with minimal errors.

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to leverage NLP and machine learning techniques to build a robust classifier capable of identifying the origin of an essay. This has practical applications in academic integrity, content verification, and understanding the stylistic differences between human and machine-generated text.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow & Methodology

The project is structured to follow a standard, professional machine learning pipeline:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Performed an initial investigation of the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing values, and analyze the class balance between AI-generated (`1`) and student-written (`0`) essays.

2.  **Text Preprocessing & Cleaning:**
    * Handled missing values by imputing the `id` and dropping rows with null text.
    * Cleaned the raw text data by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation and numbers, and stripping extra whitespace to prepare it for feature extraction.

3.  **Feature Engineering with TF-IDF:**
    * Transformed the unstructured text data into a meaningful numerical format using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.
    * This technique converts each essay into a vector that represents the importance of various words, allowing the models to learn from word usage patterns.
    * The top 1000 most significant words were selected as features.



4.  **Feature Scaling & Dimensionality Reduction:**
    * Standardized the TF-IDF feature matrix using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features have a similar scale.
    * Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space to 100 components, speeding up training and reducing noise.

5.  **Model Training & Benchmarking:**
    * Trained and evaluated several classification models to find the best performer:
        * **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with three different kernels (Linear, RBF, Polynomial).
        * **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)**, a type of Neural Network.

6.  **Hyperparameter Tuning & Evaluation:**
    * Used **GridSearchCV** to systematically find the optimal hyperparameters for the Neural Network, ensuring the best possible performance.
    * Evaluated all models using key classification metrics, including **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and the **F1-Score**.
    * Visualized model performance using **Confusion Matrices**.
